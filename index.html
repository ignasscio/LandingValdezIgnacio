                My hobbies are play videogames and watch some movies. I do both things since I can remember. The first videogame console that
                I had was a Super Nintendo, and the first movies that I watched were broadcast on TV. I've tried other things aside playing videogames,
                like, trying to play some musical instruments, like keyboard. This last one is the one wich I've spent more time on it. Someday I wanna have my own videogame.

                    My favorite movies director is Satoshi Kon, who died many years ago. His most popular movie is Perfect Blue, that was
                    showed in movie theaters for first time in 1997. My favorite movie is Paprika, named after the novel (that I hope be able to read some day).
                    Shawnshank Redemption is another of my favorite movies. I like this one because I think it's perfect when we talking about doing a movie. It has everything put properly together.

                    I've read few books in my entire life. The first novel that I read was a thriller, whom author was John Grishman. Grisham is famous for write novels about tribulations.
                    Time to kill is a novel which history talk to us of a afro-american man who has to revenge his daughter who was raped by two white men, which are put in liberty one week after.
